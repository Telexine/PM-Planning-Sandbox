# PM Planning Sandbox

### Project Plan Must Haves

1. **Objectives**

   - WIGs: The few key outcomes that matter most (4DX approach)
   - Success Criteria: What "done" looks like for different stakeholders
   - Purpose: Clarify what the project must achieve and why it matters

| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Identify the Problem**        | •  Select a defect or recurring issue to investigate. <br>•  Use severity, frequency, or business impact to prioritize.                                                    |
| **2. Classify the Problem**        | •  Determine which area is affected (e.g., process, code, environment). <br>•  Categorize to guide deeper analysis.                                                        |
| **3. Perform Root Cause Analysis** | •  Use techniques like:<br>  – 5 Whys<br>  – Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)<br>  – Fault Tree<br>  – Pareto Chart<br>•  Drill down until a systemic/root cause is identified. |
| **4. Propose Corrective Actions**  | •  Define actions to prevent future occurrences. <br>•  Could include training, test automation, policy changes, etc.                                                      |

### Root Cause Tools (Quick Reference)

| **Tool**         | **Usage**                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **5 Whys**       | •  Ask "Why?" repeatedly (3–5 times) until root cause is found.       |
| **Fishbone**     | •  Map possible causes under categories: People, Process, Tools, etc. |
| **Pareto Chart** | •  Visualize which few causes account for most issues (80/20 rule).   |
| **Fault Tree**   | •  Trace failures logically from effect to root causes.               |
